# Game Package Guidelines
This documentation is for setting guidelines when it comes to game bundles.
Archipelago can handle a very large variety of games, from platforms games to litteraly gambling.

We want to have a simililar tracker structure for every game, as much as we can.

## General Behaivor

## List of items

Key Items are separated into 3 packs

1. Goal Items. That list can differ depending on the goal set by the player. We want to have a clear idea of what a player needs to finish their game. A Goal Item is an item required to complete the game (like Power Stars on Super Mario 64, or a Dreamer on Hollow Knight). If the game doesn't have that kind of items, we display the highest value key items here, or the main inventory.
2. Major Key items/Abilities. Should contains the items that allows a player to pass major walls. Abilities will almost always be here (unless you're playing a high skill ceiling game, like Super Metroid)
3. Minor Key items. Items that unlocks a moderate bunch of checks. We don't want to put too many of them on that slot, it mainly depend on how much space we can take.
